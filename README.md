# Capstone Project Proposal

## Project Description
### [Beyond The Notes](http://beyondthenotes.net/index.php) *(Original Url)*

A Friend of Mine has a useful, but old and somewhat broken app that is a tool for music teachers and music students in both classroom and private lesson scenarios. The app provides a practice platform for music students to use at home, and teachers can use it to customize their classrooms and student lists, and to track their students' progress among many other features.

## What problem does your project solve?

My friend's app as mentioned above is functioning but needs a lot of work. There are still people who use it but over time it has become sort of buggy and there is also an issue with the paypal system.

## Who has this problem?
The product owners, the original developer of the project, and a handful of music teachers and their students who still use the old app.

## How will your project solve this problem?
A complete rebuild of the entire application using many of the original assets in more currently relevant technologies. This should eliminate bugs and give the user a fresh experience with old familiarity in terms of functionality. If successful, this project could potentially attract new users and begin generating more revenue.
